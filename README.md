#  Generate TV Scripts

### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity

### **Project 3**

Built and trained a [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to generate a new Simpsons TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern) using the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. The project was written in Python using the libraries _numpy_ and _tensorflow_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment.

#### Topics covered

- Recurrent Neural Networks
- LSTM Cells
